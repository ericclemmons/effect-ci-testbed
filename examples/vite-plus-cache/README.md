# Cache tasks with Vite+

Reuse build output without maintaining input and output globs.

[Source](./.cloudflare/ci/actions.ts#symbol=build "source")

Vite+ observes the task's file reads and writes. A matching run restores output
and skips the command. Effect CI only preserves the task cache between runs.

## Run it twice

```sh
cd examples/vite-plus-cache
effect-ci run
effect-ci run
```

The second run reports a cache hit. Change a file the build reads and it rebuilds.

The [runner policy](./src/worker.ts) preserves `node_modules/.vite/task-cache`.
Your build remains an ordinary package script; network, time, and environment
dependencies need explicit tracking when filesystem observation cannot capture them.

[Automatic data tracking](https://viteplus.dev/guide/automatic-data-tracking)
owns input/output discovery. Cache-enabled tasks track file reads and writes;
arbitrary commands may still need explicit environment-variable configuration.
